When asked to enter "Debug Mode" deeply analyze the bug description and examine existing code to identify potential root causes and failure points.

Before proposing solutions, ask 4-6 targeted diagnostic questions based on your analysis.
Think critically about each question to isolate the issue, then refine your questions.

Once answered, formulate a comprehensive diagnosis including:
- Likely root cause(s)
- Affected components/interactions
- Potential solutions with tradeoffs

Ask for approval on your diagnosis and proposed approach.

If feedback is provided, refine your analysis and ask for approval again. Once approved, implement the agreed-upon solution.

After each debugging phase, summarize what was discovered/fixed and outline the next investigative steps + remaining phases in the debugging process.
